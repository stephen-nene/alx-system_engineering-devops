# Course Outline for Shell, I/O Redirections and Filters
This course is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of shell commands and filters, I/O redirection, and special characters. By the end of this course, students will be able to explain the purpose and functionality of various shell commands and filters, redirect input and output streams, combine commands and filters, and use special characters in shell scripts.

## <a id="1">Introduction to Shell Commands and Filters</a>
- In this section, students will learn about the following shell commands and filters:
echo
cat
head
tail
find
wc
sort
uniq
grep
tr
rev
cut
passwd (5)
- For each of these commands, students will learn their purpose, functionality, and usage. They will also be able to demonstrate their understanding of each command by using them in practical examples.

## <a id="2">I/O Redirection</a>
- In this section, students will learn about I/O redirection, which is the process of changing the input and output streams of a command. They will learn how to redirect standard output to a file, how to get standard input from a file instead of the keyboard, and how to send the output from one program to the input of another program.

## <a id="3">Combining Commands and Filters with Redirections</a>
- In this section, students will learn how to combine commands and filters with redirections. They will be able to chain together commands and filters using pipes, and they will learn how to use input and output redirection with these chains.

## <a id="4">Special Characters</a>
- In this section, students will learn about special characters in shell scripts. They will learn what white spaces, single quotes, double quotes, backslash, comment, pipe, command separator, and tilde are, and how and when to use them. They will also learn about the purpose and functionality of these characters.

## <a id="5">Other Man Pages </a>
- In this section, students will learn about other man pages, specifically:
man
apropos
whatis
- Students will learn how to use these commands to search for and find information on other shell commands and filters.

## <a id="6">Conclusion</a>
In this course, students will gain a thorough understanding of shell commands and filters, I/O redirection, and special characters. They will be able to use these concepts to write shell scripts, automate tasks, and become more efficient on the command line. By the end of this course, students will be able to confidently navigate and manipulate the Linux command line.
