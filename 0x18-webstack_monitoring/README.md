## Background Context
- “You cannot fix or improve what you cannot measure” is a famous saying in the Tech industry. In the age of the data-ism, monitoring how our Software systems are doing is an important thing. In this project, we will implement one of many tools to measure what is going on our servers.

- Web stack monitoring can be broken down into 2 categories:

1. **Application monitoring:** getting data about your running software and making sure it is behaving as expected
2. **Server monitoring:** getting data about your virtual or physical server and making sure they are not overloaded (could be CPU, memory, disk or network overload)
